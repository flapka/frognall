**5A2. Sources of information**

Take information for this area from the publication itself.

**5B. Extent **

**5B1-5B14. Publications in One Physical Unit**

**5B1. General rule**

**5B1.1. **The statement of extent should account for every leaf in the volume as issued by the publisher, including leaves of text, leaves of plates, and blank leaves. It should not include leaves added as part of the binding or the binding itself.

**5B1.2. **Record the complete number of leaves, pages, or columns in accordance with the terminology suggested by the volume (or other physical unit) itself. Describe a volume with leaves numbered on both sides, or with leaves unnumbered and printed on both sides, in terms of pages. Describe a volume with leaves numbered on one side only, or with leaves unnumbered and printed on one side only, in terms of leaves. If the leaves of a volume are numbered and printed on one side only, state this fact in a note. Describe in terms of columns a volume so numbered when it is printed with more than one column to the page. If a publication contains sequences in more than one kind of numbering, record each sequence in its appropriate term as pages, leaves, or columns.

**5B1.3. **Recording the "complete number" as stated above means recording the number on the last numbered page or leaf of each numbered sequence as the basic statement of extent, with any necessary additions according to succeeding rules, e.g., 5B3, for the addition of unnumbered pages or leaves. Record arabic and roman numerals as they appear in the publication. Record roman numerals uppercase or lowercase as they appear. If the pages or leaves are lettered rather than numbered, record the first and last letters followed by the word or abbreviation indicating pages or leaves. Use arabic numerals to designate pages, etc., that are numbered in words or in characters other than arabic or roman and make an explanatory note.

x, 32 p., 86 leaves

lxiij, [1] p.

XII, 120 leaves

381 columns

a-h p.

99, [1] p.

*Note*: Pages numbered in words "one" to "ninety-nine"

**5B1.4.** If the leaves are all or chiefly non-letterpress, record them as leaves or pages of text rather than as leaves or pages of plates as in 5B9. Make a note to indicate that the leaves are non-letterpress.

LXXVI leaves

*Note*: Wholly engraved

[1], 13 leaves

*Note*: Engraved, with a letterpress t.p.

**5B2. ****Normally imposed single sheets**

For a normally imposed single-folded (i.e., 4-page) sheet, record the statement of extent in the same manner as for a volume. Apply this rule even if only one of the four pages is printed. 

1, [3] p.

*Note*: Last three pages are blank

See 5B13-5B14 for all other single-sheet publications.

**5B3.**** Unnumbered pages or leaves**

**5B3.1. **If unnumbered pages or leaves (printed or blank) are not included in a sequence of pagination or foliation, count them according to the terms used to describe the rest of the publication or the part of the publication with which they are associated. In ambiguous cases count them as leaves when they are all printed on one side only; otherwise count them as pages. Use arabic numerals within square brackets. If the gatherings are discernible, include in the count blank leaves at the beginning of the first gathering or at the end of the final gathering when they are present in a copy in hand or known to be present in other copies. Do not count possibly blank leaves wanting according to signature count and not known to exist in other copies.

(*Comment*: The unnumbered leaves introduce the following section)

64, [4] p., 16 leaves

(*Comment*: The unnumbered pages are not closely associated with either adjacent section and one or more are printed on a verso)

**5B3.2. **Consider numbered sequences to include unnumbered pages or leaves falling logically within the sequence, counting back from the recorded number to 1.

[2], 40 p.

(*Comment*: Pages are numbered 3-40 with four unnumbered pages at the beginning)

*but*	[2], 5-40 p.

(*Comment*: Pages are numbered 5-40 with two unnumbered pages at the beginning; there is no evidence that any leaves are missing)

**5B3.3. **Record in the following manner unnumbered blank pages or blank leaves interrupting a numbered sequence:

200, [8], 201-232 p.

**5B4****. Errata leaves**

Include errata leaves (but not errata slips) in the extent statement whether or not they are conjugate with another leaf of the publication. Mention the presence of errata leaves and errata slips in a note (see 7B16.1).

136, [2] p.

*Note*: Errata on p. [137]

**5B5****. Advertisements**

**5B5.1. **For pages containing only advertisements, include them in the statement of extent when they are clearly integral to the publication. This is the case when they:

are included in the same pagination sequence as the text;

*or*	are printed on the pages of an initial or final gathering also containing leaves or pages of text;

*or*	are printed on a separate gathering in a publication that is continuously signed.

**5B5.2.** Make a note to indicate the presence of pages that only contain advertisements.

124 p. 

*Note*: Advertisements on p. 119-124

121, [3] p.

*Note*: Advertisements on [3] p. at end

124, 8 p.

*Note*: Advertisements on 8 p. at end

(*Comment*: Advertisements printed on the final gathering in a publication that is continuously signed)

**5B5.3****. **Do not include in the statement of extent pages containing only advertisements that do not fall into any of these categories. Record them in a local note if considered important (see 7B19.1). *Optionally*, make a separate description for the advertisements.

278 p.

*Optional local note*: LC copy has publisher's catalog on an additional 8 p. at end

(*Comment*: Advertisements printed on a final unsigned gathering)

32 p.

*Optional local note*: UCLA copy has an additional leaf at end, with advertisements on recto and the verso blank

**5B6. Multiple sequences of numbering**

**5B6.1**. If the style of numbering within a sequence changes (e.g., from roman to arabic numerals), record each differently numbered part of the sequence. If unnumbered pages appear between the two styles of numbering, record the total number of unnumbered pages in arabic numerals within square brackets.

xii, 13-176 p.

xii, [1], 14-176 p.

**5B6.2****. **If the publication has duplicate sequences of paging, as is sometimes the case with publications having parallel texts, record both pagings and make an explanatory note.

xii, [1], 35, 35, [1] p.

*Note*: Opposite pages bear duplicate numbering

**5B6.3****. **If a volume has groups of pages numbered in opposite directions, as is sometimes the case with publications having texts in two languages, record the pagings of the various sections in order, starting from the title page selected for cataloging.

ix, [1], 155, [1], 126, x p.

**5B6.4****. **If a volume has pagination of its own and also bears the pagination of a larger publication of which it is a part, record the paging of the individual volume in this area and the continuous paging in a note.

328 p.

*Note*: Pages also numbered 501-828

**5B6.5****. **If the pages, leaves, or columns of a publication are numbered as part of a larger sequence (e.g., one volume of a multipart publication), or the copy appears to be an incomplete part of a whole, record the number of the first and the last numbered page, leaf, or column. (See also 5B12 for incompleteness at end.) Generally precede the numbers with the word or abbreviation indicating pages, leaves, or columns.

leaves 81-94

p. 713-797, [1]

(*Comment*: Fragment, detached from larger work)

*but*	[2], 713-797, [1] p.

(*Comment*: A complete publication, such as an offprint, issued separately with this pagination)

**5B6.6****. **If a publication contains more than three sequences of numbered or more than five sequences of numbered and unnumbered pages or leaves, preferably record all of the sequences. If it is not practical to record all the sequences (e.g., if they are exceedingly numerous), then employ one of the following methods:

a)	Record the total number of pages or leaves followed by "in various pagings" or “in various foliations.”

1024 p. in various pagings

256 leaves in various foliations

b)	If one of the sequences is clearly the main sequence, record the main sequence and the total number of other pages or leaves.

416 p., 98 p. in various pagings

c)	As a last resort, give one of the designations used for publications issued in more than one physical unit (see 5B15.1).

1 v. (various pagings)

If one of these methods is employed, record all of the sequences in a note if considered important.

**5B7****. Expansions or corrections**

**5B7.1. **Make a note giving more precise information about pagination or foliation, blank pages or leaves, or other aspects of collation if considered important (see 7B10).

91, [1] leaves 

*Optional note*: Last leaf blank

216 p.

*Optional note*: Pages [205]-[206] blank

vi, 744, [2] p.

*Optional note*: Leaves A7, B3, and C7 are cancels in some copies

*Optional local note*: LC copy: Leaves A7, B3, and C7 are uncancelled; the cancel leaves are between p. 742 and p. 743

**5B7.2****. **If the number of the last numbered page, leaf, or column of a sequence does not indicate the correct number of pages, etc., either record the sequences exactly to indicate the source of the error or record the number as given in the publication and supply a correction in square brackets. Provide an explanatory note if considered important.

xiv, 823 [i.e. 328] p.

*Optional note*: Page 328 wrongly numbered 823

232, 221-252 p.

*or*	252 [i.e. 264] p.

*Optional note*: Numbers 221-232 are repeated in pagination

(*Comment*: Same numbering as in preceding example)

**5B8****. Lack of numbering**

**5B8.1. **If the whole volume is unpaginated or unfoliated, count the pages or leaves and record the total in arabic numerals within square brackets. State the total in terms of pages or leaves, but not of both. Begin the count with the first page or leaf of the first gathering and end the count with the last page or leaf of the last gathering, as instructed in 5B3. Count all blank pages or leaves.

[104] p.

[88] leaves

**5B8.2. ***Optionally,* if determining the total number of pages or leaves of an unnumbered volume might damage an item in fragile condition, give one of the designations used for publications issued in more than one physical unit (see 5B15.1) followed by "unpaged" or “unfoliated.”

1 v. (unpaged)

**5B9****. Leaves or pages of plates**

**5B9.1. **Record the number of leaves or pages of plates at the end of the sequence(s) of pagination or foliation, whether the plates are found together or distributed throughout the publication. Record the number even when there is only one plate. Count a plate folded and bound at the inner margin as two leaves of plates. Count unnumbered leaves or pages of plates without regard for the terms used to describe the rest of the publication (accordingly, leaves of plates may follow sequences of pages and pages of plates may follow sequences of leaves).

246 p., 24 leaves of plates

246 p., [12] p. of plates

(*Comment*: Plates are printed on rectos and versos of 6 leaves)

x, 32, 74 p., [1] leaf of plates

[12], 275, [1] p., [1], XII leaves of plates

(*Comment*: All plates except the frontispiece are numbered consecutively)

246 p., 38 leaves of plates, 24 p. of plates

**5B9.2**. If a volume contains a mixture of unnumbered leaves and pages of plates, record the number either in terms of leaves or of pages.

**5B9.3****. **Record folded leaves as leaves or pages of plates. Make a note to indicate any folded letterpress leaves if considered important.

50, [2] p., [2] folded leaves of plates

*Optional note*: The folded leaves are letterpress tables

**5B9.4. **Count title pages (and added title pages) as leaves or pages of plates if they are entirely or chiefly non-letterpress (e.g., engraved or lithographed) and not integral to any letterpress gatherings. Make a note to indicate any title page counted as a plate.

64 p., [1] leaf of plates

*Note*: Plate has engraved t.p. on recto and blank verso

**5B9.5. **As a last resort, if a publication’s gatherings cannot be ascertained, or it is otherwise difficult to tell whether a leaf constitutes a plate, record it in terms of pages or leaves of plates if unnumbered and pages or leaves of text if included in the pagination.

**5B10. Folded leaves**

Describe folded leaves as such.

122 folded leaves

230 p., 25 leaves of plates (some folded)

306 p., [12] leaves of plates (1 folded)

**5B11****. Double leaves**

Count numbered double leaves (leaves with fold at either top or fore edge and bound at the inner margin) as pages or as leaves according to their numbering. Count unnumbered double leaves as pages (2 printed pages per double leaf) or as leaves (1 printed page per double leaf). Always indicate the presence of double leaves in a note.

[36] p.

*Note*: Printed on double leaves

[18] leaves

*Note*: Printed on 18 double leaves

72 p., 1 leaf of plates

*Note*: Plate printed on a double leaf

**5B12****. Incomplete publications**

If a volume, or an individual sequence of pages or leaves within a volume, lacks pages or leaves at its end—or an unpaginated or unfoliated volume or sequence lacks any pages or leaves—and the paging or foliation of a complete copy cannot be ascertained, record the number of the last numbered or unnumbered page or leaf followed by "+ p." or “+ leaves.” Make a note of the imperfection.

xxiv, 178+ p.

*Note*: Description based on incomplete copy; all after p. 178 wanting

[8+], 237, [1] leaves

*Note*: Description based on incomplete copy; one or more prelim. leaves (incl. t.p.) wanting

**5B13****. Sheets, rolls, cases, portfolios, etc.**

For a publication in a single physical unit other than a volume (e.g., a sheet, a roll, a case, or a portfolio), use an appropriate designation ("sheet," etc.) preceded by the arabic numeral 1. If adding a statement of pagination or foliation, place it in parentheses following the designation.

1 portfolio (26 sheets)

1 portfolio ([44] sheets)

**5B14****. Single-sheet publications**

**5B14.1. **For a publication consisting of a single sheet designed to be used unfolded (whether issued folded or unfolded), add a statement of pagination based on the number of pages printed, not counting blanks, as follows:

1 sheet (2 p.)

(*Comment*: Sheet of any size printed on both sides, numbered)

1 sheet ([2] p.)

(*Comment*: Sheet of any size printed on both sides, unnumbered)

1 sheet ([1] p.)

(*Comment*: Broadside or other sheet printed on one side, unnumbered)

**5B14.2.**** **For a publication consisting of a single sheet folded into multiple panels, include in parentheses a count of the number of physical panels on one side of the sheet when unfolded. Include both blank panels and panels containing text or illustrations in the count. Enclose the number in square brackets. Provide details of the sheet’s layout (including the numbering of the panels) in a note if considered important.

1 folded sheet ([16] panels)

*Optional note*: A folded sheet with 16 panels on each side when unfolded. All panels are unnumbered.

1 folded sheet ([4] panels)

*Optional note*: A folded sheet with 4 panels on each side when unfolded. The "outside" contains a title panel, two panels numbered 1-2, and a final blank panel. The "inside" contains a large map spread over all four panels.

6 v.

*Optional local note*: LC copy bound in 3 v.

**5B16****. Bibliographic volumes vs. physical volumes**

If the number of bibliographic volumes differs from the number of physical volumes in which a publication is actually issued, give the number of bibliographic volumes followed by "in" and the number of physical volumes. Give details of the publication’s numbering in a note, unless the numbering is given in a contents note (see 7B10).

3 v. in 5

**5D. Size and format**** **

**5D1. General rule**

**5D1.1.** Give the height of a publication (based on the copy in hand) in centimeters, rounding a fraction of a centimeter up to the next full centimeter. If a publication measures less than 10 centimeters, give the height in millimeters. If more than one copy of the publication is held, and the heights of the different copies vary, record the height of the tallest copy and give the height of the other copies in a local note.
