# 5C. Illustration 

<h2 id="5c1">5C1. General rule</h2>

__5C1.1.__ To indicate the presence of illustration, use the abbreviation `ill.` after the statement of extent. 
```
8 v. : ill.

492 p. : ill.

246 p., 32 p. of plates : ill.
```
__5C1.2.__ *Optionally*, disregard minor illustrations. 

__5C1.3.__ Do not regard ornaments (e.g., head-pieces, vignettes, tail-pieces, printers’ devices), pictorial covers, or pictorial dust jackets as illustrations. If considered important, these may be mentioned in a note (see [7B10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHg5SJYRHA0)). 

__5C1.4.__ *Optionally*, treat significant title-page illustrations as illustrations rather than ornaments. Make a note to indicate any title-page illustration so treated if considered important (see [7B10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHg5SJYRHA0)).

__5C1.5.__ *Optionally*, add the graphic process or technique in parentheses, preferably using a term found in a standard vocabulary. Give more detailed descriptions of the illustrations in a note if considered important.
```
: ill. (woodcuts)

: ill. (steel engravings)
```

<h2 id="5c2">5C2. Types of illustrations</h2>

__5C2.1.__ *Optionally*, specify particular types of illustrations. Use in alphabetical order one or more such terms as the following: `coats of arms`, `diagrams`, `facsims.`, `forms`, `geneal. tables`, `maps`, `music`, `plans`, `ports.` (use for single or group portraits), `samples`. 

__5C2.2.__ Replace `ill.` with terms specifying particular types of illustrations if the particular types are the only illustrations in the publication.
```
: maps

: ports. (Woodburytypes)
```
__5C2.3.__ Precede terms specifying particular types of illustrations with `ill.` if the particular types are not the only illustrations in the publication.
```
: ill., maps, plans

: ill. (wood engravings), maps (lithographs)
```

<h2 id="5c3">5C3. Color illustrations</h2>

__5C3.1.__ Describe color illustrations as such using the abbreviation `col.` Treat illustrations printed with a tint block (e.g., chiaroscuro woodcuts, tinted lithographs) as color illustrations.
```
: col. ill.

: ill., col. maps, ports. (some col.)

: ill. (some col.), maps, plans

: col. ill. (Baxter prints)
```
__5C3.2.__ Do not describe hand-colored illustrations as `col.` unless there is evidence that the publication was issued with the hand coloring. In case of doubt, consider any machine-press publication with hand coloring to have been issued that way by the publisher. Always mention publisher-issued hand coloring in a note (see [7B10.3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHg5SJYRHA0)); make a local note on the presence of other hand coloring if considered important (see [7B19.1.3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHg5SJYRHA0)).
```
: col. ill.
  Note: With hand-colored wood engravings 
  (Comment: Title contains statement “with colored engravings”)

: col. ill. (lithographs)
  Note: Lithographs are hand colored, as issued; see Sitwell, S. Fine bird books, p. 78
```
__5C3.3.__ If both the text and illustrations are printed in a single color, do not describe the illustrations as `col.` Make a note to indicate the color of the ink if considered important. 
```
: ill.
  Optional note: Printed in green throughout
```

<h2 id="5c4">5C4. Number of illustrations</h2>

Record the number of illustrations when their number can be ascertained readily (e.g., when the illustrations are listed and their numbers stated).
```

```

<h2 id="5c5">5C5. Publications consisting entirely or chiefly of illustrations</h2>

If a publication consists entirely or chiefly of illustrations, account for this fact by specifying `all ill.` or `chiefly ill.` Optionally, when the illustrations are all or chiefly of a particular type (see [5C2.2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHg5SJYRHA0)), replace `ill.` with the term specifying the particular type. 
```
: all ill.

: chiefly maps
```
