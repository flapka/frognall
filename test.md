#5B. Extent 
5B1-5B14. Publications in One Physical Unit
5B1. General rule
**5B1.1.** The statement of extent should account for every leaf in the volume as issued by the publisher, including leaves of text, leaves of plates, and blank leaves. It should not include leaves added as part of the binding or the binding itself.
5B1.2. Record the complete number of leaves, pages, or columns in accordance with the terminology suggested by the volume (or other physical unit) itself. Describe a volume with leaves numbered on both sides, or with leaves unnumbered and printed on both sides, in terms of pages. Describe a volume with leaves numbered on one side only, or with leaves unnumbered and printed on one side only, in terms of leaves. If the leaves of a volume are numbered and printed on one side only, state this fact in a note. Describe in terms of columns a volume so numbered when it is printed with more than one column to the page. If a publication contains sequences in more than one kind of numbering, record each sequence in its appropriate term as pages, leaves, or columns.
5B1.3. Recording the “complete number” as stated above means recording the number on the last numbered page or leaf of each numbered sequence as the basic statement of extent, with any necessary additions according to succeeding rules, e.g., 5B3, for the addition of unnumbered pages or leaves. Record arabic and roman numerals as they appear in the publication. Record roman numerals uppercase or lowercase as they appear. If the pages or leaves are lettered rather than numbered, record the first and last letters followed by the word or abbreviation indicating pages or leaves. Use arabic numerals to designate pages, etc., that are numbered in words or in characters other than arabic or roman and make an explanatory note.
> x, 32 p., 86 leaves
> lxiij, [1] p.
> XII, 120 leaves
> 381 columns
a-h p.
99, [1] p.
Note: Pages numbered in words "one" to "ninety-nine"
5B1.4. If the leaves are all or chiefly non-letterpress, record them as leaves or pages of text rather than as leaves or pages of plates as in 5B9. Make a note to indicate that the leaves are non-letterpress.
LXXVI leaves
Note: Wholly engraved
[1], 13 leaves
Note: Engraved, with a letterpress t.p.
5B2. Normally imposed single sheets
For a normally imposed single-folded (i.e., 4-page) sheet, record the statement of extent in the same manner as for a volume. Apply this rule even if only one of the four pages is printed. 
1, [3] p.
Note: Last three pages are blank
See 5B13-5B14 for all other single-sheet publications.
5B3. Unnumbered pages or leaves
5B3.1. If unnumbered pages or leaves (printed or blank) are not included in a sequence of pagination or foliation, count them according to the terms used to describe the rest of the publication or the part of the publication with which they are associated. In ambiguous cases count them as leaves when they are all printed on one side only; otherwise count them as pages. Use arabic numerals within square brackets. If the gatherings are discernible, include in the count blank leaves at the beginning of the first gathering or at the end of the final gathering when they are present in a copy in hand or known to be present in other copies. Do not count possibly blank leaves wanting according to signature count and not known to exist in other copies.
[8], 328 p.
[2], 328, [6] p.
iii, [1], 88 p.
64, [2] p., [3], 16 leaves
64 p., [2], 16 leaves
(Comment: The unnumbered leaves introduce the following section)
64, [4] p., 16 leaves
(Comment: The unnumbered pages are not closely associated with either adjacent section and one or more are printed on a verso)
5B3.2. Consider numbered sequences to include unnumbered pages or leaves falling logically within the sequence, counting back from the recorded number 
to 1.
[2], 40 p.
(Comment: Pages are numbered 3-40 with four unnumbered pages at the beginning)
but	[2], 5-40 p.
(Comment: Pages are numbered 5-40 with two unnumbered pages at the beginning; there is no evidence that any leaves are missing)
5B3.3. Record in the following manner unnumbered blank pages or blank leaves interrupting a numbered sequence:
200, [8], 201-232 p.
5B4. Errata leaves
Include errata leaves (but not errata slips) in the extent statement whether or not they are conjugate with another leaf of the publication. Mention the presence of errata leaves and errata slips in a note (see 7B16.1).
136, [2] p.
Note: Errata on p. [137]
5B5. Advertisements
5B5.1. For pages containing only advertisements, include them in the statement of extent when they are clearly integral to the publication. This is the case when they:
are included in the same pagination sequence as the text;
or	are printed on the pages of an initial or final gathering also containing leaves or pages of text;
or	are printed on a separate gathering in a publication that is continuously signed.
5B5.2. Make a note to indicate the presence of pages that only contain advertisements.
124 p. 
Note: Advertisements on p. 119-124
121, [3] p.
Note: Advertisements on [3] p. at end
124, 8 p.
Note: Advertisements on 8 p. at end
(Comment: Advertisements printed on the final gathering in a publication that is continuously signed)
5B5.3. Do not include in the statement of extent pages containing only advertisements that do not fall into any of these categories. Record them in a local note if considered important (see 7B19.1). Optionally, make a separate description for the advertisements.
278 p.
Optional local note: LC copy has publisher's catalog on an additional 8 p. at end
(Comment: Advertisements printed on a final unsigned gathering)
32 p.
Optional local note: UCLA copy has an additional leaf at end, with advertisements on recto and the verso blank
5B6. Multiple sequences of numbering
5B6.1. If the style of numbering within a sequence changes (e.g., from roman to arabic numerals), record each differently numbered part of the sequence. If unnumbered pages appear between the two styles of numbering, record the total number of unnumbered pages in arabic numerals within square brackets.
xii, 13-176 p.
xii, [1], 14-176 p.
5B6.2. If the publication has duplicate sequences of paging, as is sometimes the case with publications having parallel texts, record both pagings and make an explanatory note.
xii, [1], 35, 35, [1] p.
Note: Opposite pages bear duplicate numbering
5B6.3. If a volume has groups of pages numbered in opposite directions, as is sometimes the case with publications having texts in two languages, record the pagings of the various sections in order, starting from the title page selected for cataloging.
ix, [1], 155, [1], 126, x p.
5B6.4. If a volume has pagination of its own and also bears the pagination of a larger publication of which it is a part, record the paging of the individual volume in this area and the continuous paging in a note.
328 p.
Note: Pages also numbered 501-828
5B6.5. If the pages, leaves, or columns of a publication are numbered as part of a larger sequence (e.g., one volume of a multipart publication), or the copy appears to be an incomplete part of a whole, record the number of the first and the last numbered page, leaf, or column. (See also 5B12 for incompleteness at end.) Generally precede the numbers with the word or abbreviation indicating pages, leaves, or columns.
leaves 81-94
p. 713-797, [1]
(Comment: Fragment, detached from larger work)
but	[2], 713-797, [1] p.
(Comment: A complete publication, such as an offprint, issued separately with this pagination)
5B6.6. If a publication contains more than three sequences of numbered or more than five sequences of numbered and unnumbered pages or leaves, preferably record all of the sequences. If it is not practical to record all the sequences (e.g., if they are exceedingly numerous), then employ one of the following methods:
a)	Record the total number of pages or leaves followed by “in various pagings” or “in various foliations.”
1024 p. in various pagings
256 leaves in various foliations
b)	If one of the sequences is clearly the main sequence, record the main sequence and the total number of other pages or leaves.
416 p., 98 p. in various pagings
c)	As a last resort, give one of the designations used for publications issued in more than one physical unit (see 5B15.1).
1 v. (various pagings)
If one of these methods is employed, record all of the sequences in a note if considered important.
