__5C1.2.__ *Optionally*, disregard minor illustrations.

> : ill. (woodcuts)

## 5C2. Types of illustrations
5C2.1. Optionally, specify particular types of illustrations. Use in alphabetical order one or more such terms as the following: coats of arms, diagrams, facsims., forms, geneal. tables, maps, music, plans, ports. (use for single or group portraits), samples. 
5C2.2. Replace “ill.” with terms specifying particular types of illustrations if the particular types are the only illustrations in the publication.
: maps
: ports. (Woodburytypes)
5C2.3. Precede terms specifying particular types of illustrations with “ill.” if the particular types are not the only illustrations in the publication.
: ill., maps, plans
: ill. (wood engravings), maps (lithographs)
## 5C3. Color illustrations
5C3.1. Describe color illustrations as such using the abbreviation “col.” Treat illustrations printed with a tint block (e.g., chiaroscuro woodcuts, tinted lithographs) as color illustrations.
: col. ill.
: ill., col. maps, ports. (some col.)
: ill. (some col.), maps, plans
: col. ill. (Baxter prints)
5C3.2. Do not describe hand-colored illustrations as “col.” unless there is evidence that the publication was issued with the hand coloring. In case of doubt, consider any machine-press publication with hand coloring to have been issued that way by the publisher. Always mention publisher-issued hand coloring in a note (see 7B10.3); make a local note on the presence of other hand coloring if considered important (see 7B19.1.3).
: col. ill.
Note: With hand-colored wood engravings 
(Comment: Title contains statement “with colored engravings”)
: col. ill. (lithographs)
Note: Lithographs are hand colored, as issued; see Sitwell, S. Fine bird books, p. 78
5C3.3. If both the text and illustrations are printed in a single color, do not describe the illustrations as “col.” Make a note to indicate the color of the ink if considered important. 
: ill.
Optional note: Printed in green throughout
## 5C4. Number of illustrations
Record the number of illustrations when their number can be ascertained readily (e.g., when the illustrations are listed and their numbers stated).
: 94 ill.
: ill., 8 facsims.
: 3 ill., 1 map
: 6 col. ill. (tinted lithographs)
: 2 maps (lithographs), 1 port. (mezzotint)
: 1 ill. (engraving)
Note: Illustration is a t.p. vignette depicting a woman with raised sword and torch, with two serpents rising out of an inferno in the background 
## 5C5. Publications consisting entirely or chiefly of illustrations
If a publication consists entirely or chiefly of illustrations, account for this fact by specifying “all ill.” or “chiefly ill.” Optionally, when the illustrations are all or chiefly of a particular type (see 5C2.2), replace “ill.” with the term specifying the particular type. 
: all ill.
: chiefly maps
